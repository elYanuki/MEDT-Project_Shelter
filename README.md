## Filter for specific animal type, breed, owner or room.
Using the sidebar you can click each filter and only see those animals, that way a shelter can offer a customer all available Pudels.

## Use the editmode to create new rooms types and owners
Only the shelter owner should be able to create these new options because of that you need to enter the editmode password specified on registration.
